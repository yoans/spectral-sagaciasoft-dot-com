        <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>

        <h3>7. Your Rights & Choices</h3>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access or obtain a copy of personal information we hold about you.</li>
          <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>

          <li>Request data portability (structured, commonly used format).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submit requests to <a href="mailto:contact@sagaciasoft.com">contact@sagaciasoft.com</a>. We will verify identity (and, if applicable, authority) before fulfilling a request. Marketing emails contain opt-out links; transactional or service messages may still be sent.</p>
        <h3>8. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>We use first- and third-party cookies, local storage, and similar technologies for essential functionality, analytics, performance measurement, user preference retention, and security. You can manage or disable cookies via browser settings; some features may degrade without them.</p>
        <h3>9. Third-Party Links</h3>
        <p>Our Service may reference or link to third-party websites, tools, integrations, or social media platforms. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. We encourage you to review those policies; we are not responsible for their content or data handling.</p>
        <h3>10. Children</h3>
        <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If you believe a minor provided information, contact us for prompt removal.</p>
        <h3>11. Security</h3>
        <p>We implement administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards (e.g., access controls, encryption in transit where appropriate, monitoring). No method of transmission or storage is entirely secure; you acknowledge inherent risks when transmitting data online.</p>
        <h3>12. International Data Transfers</h3>
        <p>Your data may be processed in jurisdictions with different data protection laws. Where required, we use safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent legal mechanisms.</p>
        <h3>13. AI Transparency & Quality Review</h3>
        <p>AI interactions may be programmatically and, in limited cases, human-reviewed to improve accuracy, safety, relevance, and to troubleshoot issues. Avoid submitting sensitive personal data unless necessary for support or contractual functionality.</p>
        <h3>14. Do Not Sell / Share (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
        <p>We do not sell personal information as defined under California law. Limited disclosures to service providers are conducted under agreements prohibiting further use. If definitions evolve, we will update this section accordingly.</p>
        <h3>15. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may revise this Policy periodically. The "Last Updated" date reflects the latest material change. Significant changes may include additional notice (banner, email, or in-product message). Continued use after changes signifies acceptance.</p>
        <h3>16. Contact Us</h3>
  <p>Questions or privacy requests: <a href="mailto:contact@sagaciasoft.com">contact@sagaciasoft.com</a>. Mailing address: Sagaciasoft LLC â€“ Privacy, 6701 Corporate Dr Ste R, Johnston, IA 50131 USA.</p>
        <h3>17. Mobile Apps (Android / iOS)</h3>
        <p>This section applies when you use any Sagaciasoft mobile application distributed via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (collectively, the "Mobile App"). Unless stated otherwise, the rest of this Policy also applies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Additional Data Points:</strong> Mobile OS version, device model, app version, crash diagnostics, performance metrics (e.g., cold start time), push notification tokens, and limited analytics events (feature usage, interaction counts).</li>
          <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> If a feature requests access to microphone (voice agent), camera (image capture or video), storage (file upload), contacts (only if explicitly enabled for a business integration), or approximate location (e.g., time zone optimization), you will be prompted by the OS. Denying a permission may limit related functionality but will not block unrelated features.</li>
          <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> We use push tokens solely to deliver requested alerts (e.g., support replies, system notices). Tokens are revocable via device settings. We do not sell or share push tokens for advertising.</li>
          <li><strong>Crash & Diagnostics:</strong> Aggregated error logs and crash traces (which may include device state, stack traces, and anonymized identifiers) are used to debug reliability issues. We avoid collecting full message content in crash logs.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Certain preferences or cached AI interaction context may be stored locally (encrypted or obfuscated where practical). Clearing app data or uninstalling removes locally stored information.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Mobile analytics events are minimized and focused on quality, stability, and feature adoption. You may opt out where platform settings or in-app controls permit.</li>
          <li><strong>Updates & Permissions Changes:</strong> New features that require additional permissions will prompt before activation. You can modify access anytime in device settings (iOS Settings > App; Android Settings > Apps > Permissions).</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Policies:</strong> Use of the Mobile App is also subject to the Apple Media Services Terms and Google Play Terms. If there is a conflict, platform-required terms may govern specific distribution aspects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Uninstall / Account Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling removes local data. To request server-side deletion of retained personal data, email <a href="mailto:contact@sagaciasoft.com">contact@sagaciasoft.com</a>.</p>
